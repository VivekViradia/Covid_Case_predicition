# Covid_Case_predicition

## Project Summary
Understanding outbreak of COVID-19 in India, Comparison of India with the neighboring
countries of India, Comparison with worst affected countries in this pandemic and try and
build Machine Learning and Time Series Forecasting models to understand what are these
numbers going to be like in near future days.

## Purpose
The main objective of this document is to illustrate the requirements of the project Covid-19
Case Prediction. This build model will give the approx. number of covid-19 case in the up
coming days, which can help the people and government to take prior steps to control the rise
of covid case.
